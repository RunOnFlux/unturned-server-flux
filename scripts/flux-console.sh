# flux-console <command...>: types one command into the running server's console and prints what

#   flux-console save

#   flux-console kick SomePlayer Being rude
#
# The console is the server's stdin (a FIFO the supervisor holds open), and its answer goes to the
# server's own log (Logs/Server_<id>.log), so the answer is read back from there: the lines
# written after the command. The server writes them a second or more later (measured), so this
# waits for the log to grow, up to FLUX_CONSOLE_WAIT seconds (default 3), and then half a second
# more for the rest of the answer.
#
# Exit 1 when no server is running, 64 without a command.
